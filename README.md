## Pipeline-Builder
Pipeline Builder is an advanced no-code/low-code visual automation tool designed to simplify the creation of data processing and integration workflows. Built with a modern tech stack—React, ReactFlow, Zustand, and FastAPI—the platform empowers users to design, execute, and debug complex pipelines using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.


Whether you're a data scientist, developer, or business analyst, the Pipeline Builder allows you to connect multiple components such as API calls, database queries, LLM integrations, and transformation nodes without writing traditional code. The backend ensures robust execution using DAG validation, topological sorting, and real-time logging, while the frontend offers a seamless and responsive UI for visual workflow creation.


Key features include:

• Visual DAG-based pipeline creation

• Real-time execution with live debugging

• Pre-built functional nodes (API, conditional, loop, LLM, etc.)

• Customizable, extensible architecture for easy node addition

• Integration-ready with support for APIs, databases, and external services


The platform is ideal for:

• Automating data workflows

• Building and testing API integrations

• Visualizing business logic

• Rapid prototyping of backend processes


🔧 Tech Stack:

• Frontend: React, ReactFlow, Zustand, Material-UI

• Backend: FastAPI, Python, NetworkX, Pydantic

• Architecture: DAG-based pipeline validation and execution


✨ Features:

🧩 Visual Pipeline Editor: Drag-and-drop nodes to build data workflows

⚙️ Prebuilt Node Types: Input/Output, API Call, Text, Transform, LLM, Conditional, Loop, and more

🚀 Live Execution: Execute pipelines with custom input and get real-time output and logs

🔄 Extensible: Easily add custom node types and configurations

🧠 Built-in Validation: Ensures valid, acyclic execution flows using topological sort


✅ Use Cases:

• Data processing pipelines

• API integration flows

• Text and LLM-based automations

• Business logic workflows


📦 Example Pipelines:

[Input Node] → [API Call Node] → [Transform Node] → [Output Node]


🎯 Ideal For:

• Developers prototyping workflows

• Data teams automating pipelines

• Non-tech users visualizing and managing logic flows

• Educators demonstrating data flow and logic
