## Pipeline-Builder
Pipeline Builder is a powerful no-code/low-code visual automation platform that lets users create, manage, and execute complex data pipelines through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Designed for both technical and non-technical users, it simplifies building data workflows by providing modular components and real-time execution feedback.
Whether you're a data scientist, developer, or business analyst, the Pipeline Builder allows you to connect multiple components such as API calls, database queries, LLM integrations, and transformation nodes without writing traditional code. The backend ensures robust execution using DAG validation, topological sorting, and real-time logging, while the frontend offers a seamless and responsive UI for visual workflow creation.
